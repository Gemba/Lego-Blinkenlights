Id        | Qty | Description
--------- |:---:| ----------------
Arduino   |  1  | an Arduino device of your choice (http://arduino.cc/)
LED1,LED2 |  2  | red LED crystal clear, 3mm diameter
IR1,IR2   |  2  | Infrared/ultraviolet LED, 5mm diameter
R1-R4     |  4  | Resistor 220 Ohm
R5,R6     |  2  | Resistor 10k Ohm
Q1,Q2     |  2  | IR/UV Phototransistor, NPN, 5mm diameter

*Note*: Make sure that the phototransistor and the IR Led have the same wavelength. You may also choose ultraviolet wavelength. Your local radio shack will assist you. When choosing IR keep in mind, that the todays train remote uses 940nm as wavelength.

You also need:
 * enamelled copper wire, 0.3millimetre diameter, approx. 25metres
 * heat-shrink tubing for copperwire, approx. 15centimetre
 * a soldering iron and solder (obvious ;-) )
 * optional: a multimeter
