Assembly tips
=============

 * The Arduino Duemilanove used in this project can be programmed via an USB cable, thus no separate programmer hardware is needed. Depending on your hardware choice you may need a separate programmer.

 * See the wiring example (PDF) in this folder for suggested wire lengths. The total wire length is mainly determined by the lengths of your train compositions.

 * You should place the series resistors (R3, R4) and pull down resistors (R5, R6) in the cases for the IR (IR1, IR2) and PT (Q1, Q2).

 * Dealing with copper wire needs patience. After you have cut the lengths you may want to drill the wire pairs or triples immediately with a cordless drill. 

 * Do not forget to mark each wire on both ends or else you may need an multi meter.
