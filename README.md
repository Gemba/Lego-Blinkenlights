Lego-Blinkenlights
==================

The lego company releases level crossings from time to time in different fashions, but nearly all of them are missing signalisation (except the Set 7866 from the 12V Trains Lego heydays). My goal with this project is to add signalisation in a simple but efficient way: With an Arduino and one dozen electronic parts, and a few Lego parts you are assemble it by yourself. Maybe you get inspired by my work and have further ideas... Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!
