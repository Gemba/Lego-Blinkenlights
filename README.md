*Note*: The documentation part is preliminary and will be updated in the next days: Currently I am busy with an [exhibition](http://www.steinchenwelt.ch) (NB: On this exhibition you can see this blinkenlights in action).


Lego-Blinkenlights
==================

The lego company releases level crossings from time to time in different fashions, but nearly all of them are missing signalisation (except the Set 7866 from the 12V Trains Lego heydays). My goal with this project is to add signalisation in a simple but efficient way: With an Arduino and one dozen electronic parts, plus a few Lego parts you are able to assemble it by yourself. Maybe you get inspired by my work and have further ideas... 

Enjoy!
